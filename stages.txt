Writing a loop, step by step. For each step, implement the minimum
shown here, but also add some print() statements to see what you
are doing and show any other information you're curious about.

Stage 1. 

    Important state: none

    Loop action: pick a random number from 0 to 9
    and print it.

    Terminating condition: when the random number
    is a certain value.

Stage 2:

    Important state: none

    Loop action: request input from user

    Terminating condition: when input has a certain
    value.

Stage 3:

    Important state

        "the word to match": wordToMatch

    Loop action: request input from user

    Termining condition: when input matches or is contained
    in wordToMatch


Stage 4:

    Important state

        wordToMatch

        list of prior entries: priorEntries

    Loop action: request input from user

    Terminating condition: any condition you want to put on
    priorEntries or the user's input. Maybe when there are too
    many entries, or all the entries match, or too many non-matching
    entries. Take your pick.
